A Journal application for both official and unofficial use for university activities, programs, seminars, and so on.
So that all students and officials are aware of ongoing university activities and receive timely information through this app because it's difficult
for students and faculty members to track each and every activity happening in this spacious university campus.
For that, our team members took the initiative to build a Journal app for both official
and non-official use through which this problem is resolved, and for building this app we have used Android, Firebase Firestore, a real-time database.
We also have used various types of android libraries to build this
app user friendly.
